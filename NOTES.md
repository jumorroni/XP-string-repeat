- Start creating first test ✅ 
- Create function on production code ✅

- Refactor and check if the first test is acceptable ✅ 
- Create a test that check if the function is receiving a string ❌
- Create a condition that initialize an integer and returns true ❌

# Pomodoro 2 🍅: Driver:Juliana Navigator:Larissa
- Commit ✅

- Create a condition that initialize an integer and returns true 🚧

# Pomodoro 3 🍅: Driver:Larissa Navigator:Juliana
- Review last changes ✅
- Review our tests and function ✅
- Refactor existed tests ✅

- Create new test if necessary ✅
- Take a look at our returns ✅
- Create new test to return a string ooo ✅

- Create a new test to check next steps and make it fail ✅
- Refactor our function, should have only one if with both conditions (integer + string) ✅

- Test to should return 🚧

# Pomodoro 5 🍅: Driver:Larissa Navigator:Juliana
- Create new test that should return "oo" when n is 2 and s is "o" ✅
- Create a for condition to check our return at production code ✅
